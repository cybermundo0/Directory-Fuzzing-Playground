    <h1>My Flask App: Directory Fuzzing Playground</h1>
    <p>Welcome to this unique Flask application. At its heart, it's more than just a simple web application that creates directories. This repository is a testament to the journey of learning and improving web security techniques, particularly directory fuzzing.</p>

    <h2>The Why Behind The App</h2>
    <p>With the increasing complexity of web applications, it's ever more crucial to ensure every nook and cranny of a web app is secure. One of the often overlooked aspects of web security is unprotected directories and endpoints. Unwanted exposure can lead to potential vulnerabilities, and that's where directory fuzzing comes into play. Directory fuzzing is a technique used by security experts to discover potential security flaws by locating unprotected directories or endpoints.</p>

    <h2>What Does This App Do?</h2>
    <p>This application starts by creating 30 directories. But it doesn't stop there. Every 30 minutes, a new directory comes to life, adding a layer of dynamism. This functionality serves two core purposes:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Continuous Learning: As new directories pop up, it offers a fresh challenge for those honing their fuzzing skills.</li>
        <li>Automation in Fuzzing: This ever-evolving landscape is perfect for those looking to automate their fuzzing techniques. Imagine setting up an alert system that notifies you every time a new endpoint is discovered. It's not just about finding directories; it's about automating responses to such discoveries.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Dockerized for Flexibility</h2>
    <p>Understanding the diverse environments security professionals work in, this app is containerized using Docker. Whether you're running a Windows machine, a Mac, or a Linux distribution, Docker ensures this application can be spun up locally, offering a consistent testing ground for your fuzzing experiments.</p>

    <p>So, whether you're a seasoned security expert or someone just starting with fuzzing, this application aims to be your playground, your challenge, and most importantly, a step towards making the web a safer place.</p>
